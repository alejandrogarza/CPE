# A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 Ã— 99.

# Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.

# def solution():
#   largest_three_digit_product = 999 * 999
#   for i in range(largest_three_digit_product, 1, -1):
#     if i == int(str(i)[::-1]):
#       return i
# this doesnt make it a product of 3... 997799 wouldnt work

def is_palindrome(i):
  return i == int(str(i)[::-1])

def solution():
  max_palindrome = 1
  for x in range(999, 100, -1):
    for y in range(999, x-1, -1):
      if is_palindrome(x*y) and x*y > max_palindrome:
        max_palindrome = x*y
